But if you want to use your own supabase project then follow the steps below:

First we need to setup supabase project for our app before we can use it.

Project setup:
- create an account on https://supabase.com.
- create a new project.
- copy the contents of schemas.sql file (you can find this file in the root directory of this project)
- go to SQL Editor in the side bar of you supabase project
- past the copied content in the editor and click on run button (there will be a green run button at the bottom) 
- after this you'll be able to see all the tables, relationships, policies, buckets, triggers and functions.

Authentication:
- go to Authentication in the side bar then go to providers.
- enable the email provider (if not enabled already)
- click on the email provider and turn off the 'Confirm email' option and save it

API Keys:
- go to Project Settings in the sidebar and click on API option in the side bar.
- copy the Project URL and past it in the constants/index.js file in the supabaseUrl veriable.
- copy the anon key and past it in the constants/index.js file in the supabaseAnonKey veriable. 

supabase setup is finished now you can run the following commands to run the app:
- npm install
- npm run start

Enjoy 😉
